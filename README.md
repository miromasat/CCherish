The objective of this thesis is to conduct a study and implement system of numerical database using a weighted tree data structure. The implementation in the language C++ will be compared to original design implemented in Fortran programming language. The significant portion of this thesis will be dedicated to discussion of ways to modify the database to allow parallel execution and hence, to work effectively on such systems. Conclusion will present the viability of usage of either sequential or parallel variant of the algorithm.
